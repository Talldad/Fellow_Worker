Football, Meat Pies, Kangaroos (and Holden Cars) was a 1970s advert representing icons of Australian life, and they are familiar to those of us who have grown up with them.

But our migrant neighbours, who already struggle with English as a language, face the additional barrier of trying to understand what on earth we carry on about - especially during the winter sports season.

The Ashburton congregation began in the 1950s and grew rapidly with post-war resettlement. It was well-placed to serve the new wave on non-English-speaking migrants who were billeted in the (equally iconic) Nissen huts down the hill in Holmesglen. Members were very active in demonstrating God's love in practical ways to help the newcomers cope with Aussie life and lingo.

Today the congregation is much smaller but there is a new wave of migration as the area boasts a growing Asian population of both permanent residents (coming to rejuvenate the old area) and international students attending the upgraded Holmesglen TAFE/University.

The present congregation has accepted the challenge to again demonstrate God's love to new Australians by reaching out with an ESL program (now in its fourth year) and plans for a cross-cultural ministry - you might call it "Ashburton: The Next Generation."
